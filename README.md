# Grybu karas
"Gryb≈≥ karas" is a pixelated 2D adventure game where the protagonist hero fights mushrooms. The player is controlled using keyboard arrows and mouse for aiming a weapon and attacking. The game starts with the easiest level and gets progressively more difficult as the levels go by. The hero has to deal with more and more mushrooms and difficult jumps as they go on. The enemy grows stronger with each level and the protagonist can strengthen his attack by collecting power-ups, or weaken and lose hearts and die if he is attacked by the enemy. Along the way the player can collect coins which are either placed in the level or dropped by enemies wehn they are killed. Collected power-ups can give the player more hearts or buff their attacks. The weapons a player uses can be changed by finding a new weapon in a level and collecting it. Some weapons are short ranged such as baseball bats or swords, others are long ranged such as pistols. The hero's life is visible and counted by the hearts on the top left of the screen and if all the hearts go empty, the character dies and the level must be restarted. The collected coins and buffs are also visible in the top left of the screen. The game reaches an end when the player conquers all 5 levels.
